# Contributing to `bootstrap-mac-dev`

👋 Welcome! Whether you're suggesting improvements or fixing something that bugs you — thank you!

## 📋 Ground Rules

- The `main` branch is protected. No direct pushes are allowed.
- All changes must go through a pull request (PR).
- Only the Code Owner (`@xebu`) can approve and merge PRs.
- Keep your changes small, focused, and meaningful.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Fork the repo or clone it if you're the maintainer.
2. Run `make` to bootstrap your machine.
3. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature
   ```

## 📦 Making Changes

- Try to keep each script focused and modular.
- Follow the naming conventions used in the existing scripts.
- If adding new packages or tools, include a comment explaining the rationale.

## ✅ Pull Requests

- Include a clear description of **what** and **why**.
- If it's a visual/script change, show before/after examples where possible.
- Link to any related issues or discussions.
- The PR template will help guide you through.

Happy hacking! 🚀
